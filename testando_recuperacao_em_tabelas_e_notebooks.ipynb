      "3. **Geological Context**:\n",
      "   - The Noctis Labyrinthus region is known for its unique terrain that includes deep valleys and ridges, suggesting a complex geological history that might be relevant for understanding Mars' past climate and potential for past life.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Scientific Objectives**:\n",
      "   - Investigating the geological features surrounding Noctis Landing could provide valuable information about the history of water on Mars, tectonic activity, and volcanic processes.\n",

      "1. **Temperature Stability**: Between December 1 and December 2, the average temperature remains relatively stable, fluctuating around -44.32°C. This indicates a period of consistent temperature without significant changes.\n",

      "2. **Sharp Increase**: A notable increase in temperature occurs after December 2, with the temperature rising sharply to approximately -44.22°C by December 3. This suggests a sudden change in environmental conditions or an event influencing the temperature.\n",
