Answer with a SQLite query that returns useful information to answering the specific prompt.
Avoid generating a query that returns a large number of rows.
Prefer queries with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc, since the results are usually more concise and informative.

You should create a SQLite query that queries the table {{table_name}}, that is equivalent to the file {{file_path}}.

[[Start of your {{table_name}} summary]]
{{ table_summary }}
[[End of your {{table_name}} summary]]

Your query should help to answer the following prompt:
'{{specific_prompt}}'

Your answer should follow the format below:
{
    "query": "The SQLite query that returns useful information to answer the prompt."
}
Example:
{
    "query": "SELECT * FROM {{table_name}} LIMIT 10;"
}
Another example:
{
    "query": "SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(column_name) FROM {{table_name}};"
}
